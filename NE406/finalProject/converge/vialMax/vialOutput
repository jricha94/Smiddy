1status of the statistical checks used to form confidence intervals for the mean for each tally bin


 tally   result of statistical checks for the tfc bin (the first check not passed is listed) and error magnitude check for all bins

        6   missed  2 of 10 tfc bin checks: the relative error exceeds the recommended value of 0.1 for nonpoint detector tallies     
         missed all bin error check:     1 tally bins had     0 bins with zeros and     1 bins with relative errors exceeding 0.10


 the 10 statistical checks are only for the tally fluctuation chart bin and do not apply to other tally bins.

 warning.       1 of the     1 tally fluctuation chart bins did not pass all 10 statistical checks.
 warning.       1 of the     1 tallies had bins with relative errors greater than recommended.
